## DSI Capstone 3 Proposal

### Proposal 1 : Coloring Within the Lines

I would like to replicate the DeOldify program, where it colorizes a black and white video. My minimum viable product would be a program that takes a BW photo and colorizes it. The main goal would be to expand it to a entire movie scene.

### Proposal 2 : Image Translator

Source of Idea : https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/how-google-translate-squeezes-deep.html    &    https://lens.google/

I will try to replicate this translator. The minimum viable product would be to translate one image into another language, for example an image of a stop sign. The further down goal would be to use the program to translate bits of the Rosetta Stone. 


### Proposal 3 : Forecasting Wildfires

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires

"In 2019 there were 50,477 wildfires compared with 58,083 wildfires in 2018, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)."

I would like to do a time series forecasting on Wildfires. The results will hopefully be useful in increasing response time which might prevent total area affected by wildfires.


### Proposal 4 : GitHub Repo/Project Recommender System

I would build a Flask Recommender System, that takes in your public github profile, reads some of the topics in the repos you have and suggests trendy projects to round out your online presence. There will be a section with online sentiment (if any) towards certain projects topics. For example, I thought of this project when reading random reddit posts on data science and one commenter said that he was sick and tire of seeing projects concerning the Titanic Dataset.
