## DSI Capstone 1 Proposal

### Proposal 1 : Bicycle Data for Australia

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/bicycle-store-dataset?select=Transactions.csv

* I am planning on testing out which key demographics yield the most bike purchases or if demographics don't really matter.
* I will also test to see which areas of Australia sell the most bikes or if the spread of transactions is uniform throughout Australia.

  * This dataset has 4 csv files and a usability score of 9.1. They cover the customer information of bicycle purchasers in Australia. 
  * The Transactions.csv file has 20.0k rows. 


### Proposal 2 : Flight Data & Forex

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/brunotly/foreign-exchange-rates-per-dollar-20002019    &     https://www.kaggle.com/open-flights/flight-route-database

* I was going to use both datasets to see if the amount of travelers to certain countries have a profound effect on that country's currency value.
* The conclusions can be used to see if cross-country travel plans are a viable metric to consider when Forex trading.

### Proposal 3 : Demographics of an Individual Hypothesis Testing

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey?select=responses.csv

* I would like to see if the demographics of different people have an effect on different facts, habits or opinions those people have. 
* This can be used for targeted advertisements .
